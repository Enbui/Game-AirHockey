#  Update motion of ball in this game
- sorry for delaying
I am very sorry for the late update, because recently I have many jobs at the company that I am practicing.
I limited the range of padding 2 motion to a grid, and was handling the ball movement with a random number generator to change the direction of the ball. However, there was an error with the collision of the ball and padding2.
I will continue to fix and improve the game
I am very sorry once again for the delay, and look forward to your comments

# issue of import, export class
Thank you for wathching, and I so sorry for delaying.
Because of problem about import and export class, I am having difficulty checking code. Therefore, this project may have some error.
i have read the instrucions to resolve this issue: add type = " module" to script tag in index.html file 
  <script type = "module" src="./src/index.js"></script> 
or install webpack and babel to use ES6, but they can't resolve this issue. 
I look forward to the guidance on this issue.
Thank you for wathching, and I so sorry for delaying.
